# CozyHome: Your Pet's Homely Haven 🏡🐾

Welcome to the CozyHome repository—a website dedicated to providing cozy and professional services for your beloved pets. Our project is built using cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js and React to create a comfortable online space for taking care of your furry companions.

## Technologies

- **Next.js:** We use Next.js to build powerful web applications with server-side rendering, ensuring fast and responsive interaction with our website.

- **React:** The entire interface is built using the React library, enabling us to create reusable components and provide declarative control over the interface.

## Project Structure

The project follows the Full Stack Development (FSD) methodology, providing a clear and organized structure.
